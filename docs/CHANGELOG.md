# Changelog

Notable changes since **v1.0.0**, reconstructed from Git history and published
release notes. Release dates are GitHub publication dates.

Redeploy Client/Server and Redeploy.Core have **separate version numbers**.
Release 1.0.1 contains Client/Server 1.0.1 and Core 1.0.10; release 1.0.0
contains Core 1.0.8.

## Unreleased — Core 1.0.11

- Fontaine FOV Fix 4.1.0+: refresh camera/weapon ownership after replacement and
  fence callbacks from the retired body.
- Manimal Ammo Loading Animations 2.0.0+: retire per-body loading sessions and
  prevent delayed animation work from returning to an old character.
- Both integrations live in the shared Core for ArenaMode and standalone
  Redeploy. The foreign mods remain optional; the public API remains version 1.
  Client/Server release versions are unchanged.

See [implementation and verification](FOV-MANIMAL-COMPAT-20261025.md).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-24

### Shared body-replacement compatibility — Core 1.0.10

- Moved general body-replacement fixes for **Recoil Rework Legacy 2.0.0+,
  Continuous Load Ammo 1.2.0+ and Continuous Healing 1.6.3+** from ArenaMode
  into Redeploy.Core. Standalone Redeploy now uses the same integrations without
  requiring ArenaMode. All three mods remain optional.
- **Recoil Rework Legacy:** transfer recoil/camera component ownership to the
  replacement character, refresh its equipped-weapon cache and prevent retired
  components from interfering with the new body.
- **Continuous Load Ammo:** rebind the loading controller after replacement and
  isolate old disposal, movement restrictions and delayed completion from the
  new character's inventory and loading operation.
- **Continuous Healing:** prevent callbacks from the retired body from starting
  or cancelling healing on its successor, while retaining the mod's behavior
  on the current living player. Unrelated ordinary bots remain unchanged.
- Validate optional-mod compatibility before tearing down the old player.
  Standalone Redeploy shows a raid-start notice if respawning is unavailable;
  failed admission leaves normal death handling in place. Newer mod versions
  still need the expected APIs and produce an unverified-version warning.
- Reject conflicting older ArenaMode adapters before installing duplicate hooks.
  Update ArenaMode and its matching Core together when using these integrations.
- Raised this release's minimum Core requirement to **1.0.10**. The existing
  `RespawnApi` version 1 observer contract and event sequence remain unchanged.

### Verification

- Added shared lifecycle and optional-mod regression checks, including failed
  preparation/recovery and delayed callbacks from retired bodies.
- Recorded bounded native tests for standalone respawns, corpse-weapon recovery,
  shooting, continuous healing and magazine unloading, plus Arena Deathmatch
  replacements and solo Zombie wave refills. These do not establish every
  asynchronous race, PitFireTeam behavior, or future mod-version compatibility.

See [shared compatibility and verification boundaries](BODY-REPLACEMENT-COMPAT-20261023.md)
for the tested builds, scenarios and remaining limits.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-19

Baseline for this changelog: the `v1.0.0` tag at
[`d1d7240`](https://github.com/maschine34675/Redeploy/commit/d1d7240),
with **Client/Server 1.0.0 and Core 1.0.8**. Its archive was refreshed on
2026-10-19 without changing the Client/Server version; earlier same-version
archives are not reconstructed here.

The respawn choices, corpse-gear recovery, retained equipment, protection/cost
settings and existing Killcam, DoorDash, DynamicMaps and Freecam integrations
already belong to this baseline. See its
[README](https://github.com/maschine34675/Redeploy/blob/v1.0.0/README.md)
for the features and limitations at release.
